During the Machine Learning (Classification and Regression) class, we were given a Classification and Regression task based on the algorithms we learned in the classroom. 
I was in a team, we worked in pairs. My teammate was responsible for Regression task and I was responsible for Classification task. The main idea behind the classification task
was to use at least 3 classification algorithms to build accurate model for predicting the insurance data. I used Logistic Regression, Lasso, Ridge, and KNN out f which Logistic regression was the most 
accurate one predicting 78% correctly on the test data
